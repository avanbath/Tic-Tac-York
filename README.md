# Tic-Tac-York Web Application Project
	Repository for the Tic-Tac-York web application. This repository is based on the tic-tac-toe game idea from EECS1012 at York University.

Project Title: Tic-Tac-York

## Description
Following principles of the software development life cycle, we will be creating a customized and unique version of tic-tac-toe in the form of a web application, which is based on one of the suggested EECS1012 projects provided. The web app will consist of a dynamic, minimalistic user interface with a primary game area for player interaction, including a legend with the rules and helpful tips for the player. The game will follow the traditional tic-tac-toe rules, in which two players (user and computer opponent, or user versus user) take turns adding their assigned unique mark to a 3x3 grid until one player has matched 3 marks in a row, in any direction, to win. Users will have the option to choose their preferred mark before starting the game. Other useful features, such as local weather information based on the location of the player, will also be part of this web application for the player's convenience, and to fulfill the purpose of our project being truly one-of-a-kind.

## Functional Requirements
- Users can play a game of tic-tac-toe versus a computer-controlled opponent or another local user with a visual board display
- Users will be shown a welcome screen with the option to play, customize their mark, or learn how to play the game
- Users can interact with a “Play” button that will allow them to select from two game modes; player versus computer or player versus player
- Users can interact with a “Tips and Tricks” button during the game to get helpful hints and tips to improve their strategy
- Users can view their local weather forecast on the bottom-right of the screen, shown as widget that can be hidden/minimized for convenience
- Users can select from a short list of icons (referred to as "marks") to use as their symbol for the game by pressing the "Customize Mark" button in the main menu
- In either game mode, users will go first/second based on random decision (to ensure fairness), and users will be told the decision once the game begins
- Users can take turns with their opponent by interacting with the 3x3 grid, placing their symbol in any of the available spaces (mouse click)
- If a user makes an illegal move (for example, if the space clicked on is already filled), then they will be prompted to choose an open space on the grid
- A user can win the game by matching 3 of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, diagonally, or vertically
- In a game versus a computer, a user can lose the game if the computer-controlled opponent matches 3 of their symbols in a row horizontally, diagonally, or vertically
- Users can tie the game if neither them nor the opponent is able to satisfy the win condition before all the spaces in the grid are filled
- Users are notified of their or their opponent's victory (or a tie) once the game has finished
- Users can choose to play the game again or they can return to the main menu
