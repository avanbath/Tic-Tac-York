Project Title: Tic-Tac-York

Description: Following SDLC principles, we will be creating a customized version of a tic-tac-toe web application, which is based on one of the suggested projects provided. The web app will consist of a dynamic user interface with a game area for player interaction, including a legend with the rules and helpful tips for the player. The game will follow the traditional tic-tac-toe rules, in which two players (user and computer opponent) take turns adding their assigned unique mark to a 3x3 grid until one player has matched 3 marks in a row, in any direction, to win. The user may choose their preferred mark from a list beforehand. Local weather information will also be displayed as a side feature.

Requirements:
- Users can play a game of tic-tac-toe versus a computer-controlled opponent in HTML format
- Users can interact with a “Play” button to initiate a game of tic-tac-toe
- Users can interact with a “Tips and Tricks” button to get helpful hints and tips to improve their strategy 
- Users can view their local weather forecast and current weather on the bottom of the screen
- Users can select from a short list of icons to use as their symbol for the game by pressing the "Customize" button
- Users will either go first or second based on random decision from the computer (to ensure fairness) and then the user will be told the decision
- In the game the user will take turns with the computer-controlled opponent interacting with the 3x3 grid, placing their symbol in any of the available spaces 
- Users can win the game by matching 3 of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, diagonally, or vertically
- Users can lose the game if the computer-controlled opponent matches 3 of their symbols in a row either horizontally, diagonally, or vertically
- Users can tie the game (cat’s game) if neither them or the opponent is able to satisfy the win condition before all the spaces in the 3x3 grid are filled
