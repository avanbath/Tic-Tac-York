Project Title:

Tic-Tac-York


Description:

Following SDLC principles, we will be creating a customized version of a Tic-Tac-Toe web application, which is based on one of the suggested projects provided. The web app will consist of a dynamic user interface with a game area for player interaction, including a legend with the rules and helpful tips for the player. The game will follow the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules, in which two players (user and computer opponent) take turns adding their assigned unique mark to a 3x3 grid until one player has matched 3 marks in a row, in any direction, to win. The user may choose their preferred mark from a list beforehand. Local weather information will also be displayed as a side feature.


Users can play a game of tic-tac-toe versus a computer-controlled opponent in HTML format

Users can interact with a “play” button to initiate a game of tic-tac-toe

Users can interact with a “tips and tricks” button to get helpful hints and tips to improve their strategy 


Users can view their local weather forecast and current weather
